<p>In this experiment you will hear 120 “fake English” utterances, composed of English-like nonsense words. These utterances were all originally either real English poetry (artistic English) or real English prose (“normal” English). The original English has been carefully garbled so that the original meaning is gone, but aspects of the language’s <em>sound</em> remain.</p>
<p>Your job is to use your intuition as an English speaker to guess which pseudo utterances were originally poetry, and which were prose. You will hear each utterance once then respond by clicking either the “Prose” or “Poetry” button; after you click, you’ll hear the next utterance.</p>
<p>Feel free to take breaks every 10–20 utterances, if you need to. When you are ready to begin, click the button below!</p>
