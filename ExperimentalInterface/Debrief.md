Thanks for all your hard work! You are done!

If you have *any* comments about the experiment, please write them in below. 
We'd be particularly interested in hearing what strategies you used to do this task and what you noticed was different between the prose and the poetry examples.

# Debrief


Thanks again!

By participating in this research, you'll be helping us understand how and why humans perceive *rhymes*&#8212;in particular, a form of rhyme known as **assonance**.
Assonant rhymes occur when poets reuse certain vowels.
The main difference between the poetry and prose you just heard was how vowels were being reused.
In the poetry examples, the poets often use the same sequences of vowels in certain places in the poetic lines.

If you have any additional questions or concerns, contact Nat Condit-Schultz at natcs[at]gatech.edu.
