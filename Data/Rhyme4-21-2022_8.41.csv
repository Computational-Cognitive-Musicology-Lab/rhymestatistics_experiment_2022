This research will help us better understand how artists use the sounds of human language to create art, especially in poetry and song lyrics. This study is intended for native speakers of English of <em>any</em> dialect&#8212;we&#39;re afraid we can&#39;t accept participation from anyone else. If you are a native English speaker, your participation is extremely valuable to us and we thank you for helping out!</p> <p>The study should take approximately 20&#8211;30 minutes to complete. Your participation in this study is always voluntary and you may discontinue your participation at any time.</p> <h4 id=""ethics"">Ethics:</h4> <p>This study has been reviewed by the Georgia Tech Institutional Review Board, and has been identified as &#8220;Minimal risk research&#8221; (Ethics ID #H22081). The risks of participating in this study are no greater than any casual poetry listening or other normal daily activities.</p> <h4 id=""confidentiality"">Confidentiality:</h4> <p>We will comply with any applicable laws and regulations regarding confidentiality. Your responses to the study questions will be entirely anonymous and confidential. No personal data will be gathered from you, and your identity will never be associated with your data, published, or disclosed in any way.</p> <p>To make sure that this research is being carried out in the proper way, the Georgia Institute of Technology IRB may review study records.

These utterances were all originally either real English poetry (artistic English) or real English prose (&#8220;normal&#8221; English). The original English has been carefully garbled so that the original meaning is gone, but aspects of the language&#39;s <em>sound</em> remain.</p><p>Some of the utterances you'll hear are short, while others are longer with a short pause in the middle.</p><p> <b>Short example:</b> <audio controls><source src='Stimuli/nonrhyme_24_oneline.mp3' type='audio/mp3'></source></audio></p><p> <b>Long example:</b><audio controls><source src='Stimuli/nonrhyme_2_twolines.mp3' type='audio/mp3'></source></audio></p><p>Your job is to use your intuition as an English speaker to guess which pseudo utterances were originally poetry, and which were prose. You will hear each utterance once then respond by clicking either the 'Prose' or 'Poetry' button; after you click, you'll hear the next utterance. Note that the length of the utterance (short or long) is <em>not</em> related to the prose/poetry question!</p> <p>Feel free to take breaks every 10&#8211;20 utterances, if you need to.</p><p>When you are ready to begin, click the button below!</p>",0,html-button-response,4,73580,0.0-4.0,,,,
