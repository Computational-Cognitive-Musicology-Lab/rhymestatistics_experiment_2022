Hi `___`

We are looking for volunteers to participate in an online experiment we are conducting concerning the artistry of the English language.
This study is open to any adult (18 years or older) who is a native speaker of any dialect of English and who is *not* currently located in the European Union.
We'd love it if you would be willing to help us out!
The study should only take about 20--30 minutes of your time.
Unfortunately, there would be no compensation to you, other than the good feeling of helping science!

If you meet these criteria and are interested in participating, please navigate to [ccml.gtcmt.gatech.edu/Mixing/interface.html](https://ccml.gtcmt.gatech.edu/Mixing/interface.html).
If you have any questions or problems, contact Robert Kimelman at [rkimelman3@gatech.edu](mailto:rkimelman3@gatech.edu).

Thanks!

Nat Condit-Schultz
